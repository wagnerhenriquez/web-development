            <h2>our story</h2>
            <p>Clean Juice® was started in 2014 by Kat and Landon Eckles. Landon’s career required him to travel frequently and be away from Kat and their children. Kat and Landon decided to put their destiny in their own hands by starting a new business. Kat’s passion for healthy living led her to present the idea of starting a certified organic Juice Bar. They jumped into the idea with 100% motivation and heart and on June 5, 2015, the first Clean Juice® location opened its doors in Huntersville, North Carolina. In just a few short years Clean Juice has grown exponentially and is the only USDA-certified organic juice bar franchise around.</p>

            <h2>why franchise</h2>
            <p>Starting a business is a ton of work. Starting a juice and smoothie bar is no different. Buying a franchise is the simplest way to start your own business. By purchasing a franchise you remove a lot of the guesswork that goes into opening a business. Clean Juice is one of the fastest growing franchises in the country and the only USDA-certified organic franchise available. We know what it takes to open and run an awesome juice and smoothie bar and we share every bit of our knowledge with our Franchise Partners to ensure their success.</p>
